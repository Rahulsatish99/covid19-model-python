The above results are solely-based on the dataset provided in the github repo and kaggle page(ref), which cannot be taken as a true form of data. Hence, this is just a proof of concept that Convolutional Neural Network can be used for such rough estimations, provided the models are trained with large datasets and suffient accuracy is acheived.
